# Sandcastles

## Idea
- A game where the main story is about how there's a sand castle/ sand sculpture competition coming up like the one in primel and you have to get ready to participate
- You play as a little girl who hears about the sandcastle competition and wants to join. The game is about practicing, finding the tools, creating a team to join the competition

## Inspirations
- Carto
- A short hike
- Oxenfree

## Mechanics
- Small dialogue system
- Running around
- Pick things up
- Cool mechanic where you use different (very basic) tools to build a sculpture:
	- Bucket to make piles
		- Sand = normal pile of dry sand
		- Sand + water = more solid blob of sand
	- Spade to carve out
	- Decorate with shells/seaweed
- Mini quest system
	- Build a sandcastle with a set of rules : To practice building sand castle the player will have rules to judge if sculpture is good like use 7 buckets of wet sand, 1 bucket of dry sand and use spade 8 times
